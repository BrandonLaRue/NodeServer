# NodeServer
An attempt at making a simple web server with Node js

'testServer.js' is the server

If you attempt to run the server, you may need to change the defaultPath variable 
to reflect where the web pages you wish to serve are located

All of the included web pages were probably made in middle school, so please ignore the content.
